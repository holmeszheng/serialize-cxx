Serialization and Deserialization - C++ Edition
===============================================

Problem Definition
------------------

You are tasked with writing a serialization system for an online service, such as might be used for a 
game engine.

Tests are included and should not be modified. The test harness will use Serializer::serialize() and
Deserializer::deserialize() to accomplish that.  Your job is to write a serialization system that makes 
the tests pass.

A CMakeLists.txt file is provided for convenience. It should support everything you need to 
build and test the project, for example:
 #> cmake .
 #> make
 #> ./DevTestTests

Restrictions
------------
- Don't use any built in compression or serialization tools or libraries
- Don't use any third party compression or serialization tools or libraries
- Please do not submit hidden files (.idea, .DS_Store, Thumbs.db, etc) with your solution.
